## Question 6 Part A - What are some questions and prediction tools you could create using these data? 
With this dataset, several predictive tools and research questions could be developed. Specifically, we could use a model to predict the likelihood that force will be used in an interaction with Minnesota police officers. We wonder which problem types are most strongly associated with the type of force used (or any at all) or the severity of outcomes. We also could ask if demographic factors, such as race, sex, and age, predict differences in the force types.

## Question 6 Part B - Who would the stakeholder be for that prediction tool? 
Police departments and training units could use the predictions to guide de-escalation training. Community organizations and policymakers could monitor disparities and push for accountability. Researchers studying public safety and criminal justice outcomes could evaluate policy effectiveness, inform reforms, or share analyses in peer-reviewed journals to expand knowledge of systemic issues and support community advocacy.

## Question 6 Part C - What practical or ethical questions would it create? 
Practically, how accurate are these predictions? Or, do risks increase from reinforcing existing systemic biases by using race or neighborhoods?

## Question 6 Part D - What other data would you want, that are not available in your data?
Context of the incident, officer-level data, outcome data, socioeconomic data.
